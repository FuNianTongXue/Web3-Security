# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to Web3-Security.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `master`.
2. Keep commits focused and descriptive.
3. Run relevant tests/lint checks before opening a PR.
4. Open a pull request with:
   - Summary of changes
   - Impact/risk notes
   - Verification steps

## Commit Message Convention

Use concise prefixes:
- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation only
- `refactor:` code restructuring without behavior change
- `test:` tests
- `chore:` maintenance

## Quality Expectations

- No secrets or tokens in commits.
- No local caches/build artifacts committed.
- Keep top-level structure clear and English-first for discoverability.
